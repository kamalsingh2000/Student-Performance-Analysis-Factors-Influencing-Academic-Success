# Student-Performance-Analysis-Factors-Influencing-Academic-Success

This project delves into the intricate web of factors influencing student performance. Leveraging Python, along with the powerful libraries pandas and Seaborn, we conduct a detailed examination of a diverse dataset encompassing demographic details and academic scores.

Key Findings:
Gender Disparities: Males excel in Mathematics, while females outperform in Reading and Writing.

Ethnicity Impact: Scores show a linear progression from Group A to E, signifying its influence.

Parental Education: Highly educated parents correlate with higher student scores.

Diet Matters: Students on a standard diet consistently achieve higher scores.

Test Preparation: Diligent test preparation leads to improved performance.

Additionally, we identify attributes with minimal impact, such as parental marital status, sports participation, birth order, transportation mode, and weekly study hours.

This analysis provides invaluable insights for educators and policymakers, informing targeted strategies to enhance educational outcomes. It highlights the power of data analysis in driving informed decision-making in the realm of education.

Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Seaborn: For creating visually informative statistical graphics.
